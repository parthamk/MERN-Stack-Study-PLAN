This study plan helped me to learn advanced MERN stack development within two weeks. Based on your learning capabilities it could take more time. Here's a breakdown of the study plan with recommended video resources:

Week 1:
- **Days 1-2:** Start by solidifying your fundamentals of React. Watch and follow along with the tutorials from the React Crash Course by Traversy Media: [React Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) (Duration: 1.5 hours)
- **Days 3-4:** Dive deeper into React concepts and learn about React hooks. Watch the React Hooks Crash Course by Traversy Media: [React Hooks Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxK8b99iJTg) (Duration: 1.5 hours)
- **Days 5-6:** Now that you have a solid foundation in React, it's time to move on to learning the basics of Node.js and Express. Watch the Node.js Crash Course by Traversy Media: [Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4) (Duration: 1.5 hours)

Week 2:
- **Days 7-8:** Explore MongoDB and Mongoose, which are essential for working with databases in the MERN stack. Watch the MongoDB Crash Course by Traversy Media: [MongoDB Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPP_1eAENg) (Duration: 1 hour)
- **Days 9-11:** Integrate React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB by building a full-stack MERN project. Follow the MERN Stack Front To Back series by Traversy Media: [MERN Stack Front To Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_fKEJpEEps&list=PLillGF-RfqbaxgxkKgKk1XlJAVCX31xRI) (Duration: 6.5 hours)
- **Days 12-14:** Dive into advanced MERN stack concepts and explore additional libraries and tools. Watch the Advanced React & Redux series by Stephen Grider: [Advanced React & Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM&list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg) (Duration: 6.5 hours)

By following this study plan and dedicating 6 hours per day, you should be able to gain a solid understanding of advanced MERN stack development within two weeks. Remember to code along with the tutorials, practice what you learn, and build your own projects to reinforce your knowledge.

Good luck with your studies!
